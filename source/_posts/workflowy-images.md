# WorkFlowy Images

I made a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cnecfoeoohjnimhbcojcdfhhdllgleck) (and [Tampermonkey script](https://github.com/jonleung/workflowy-images#tampermonkey-installation)) to embed images into your
[WorkFlowy](http://workflowy.com)!

## Public Service Announcement

Two Things

### 1) WORKFLOWY IS AMAZEBALLS!

Please use [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) to be more productive.
The only reason you shouldn't use WorkFlowy is because you're an OG who uses
[Emacs org mode](https://www.google.com/?#q=emacs+org+mode)
(I tried and failed to pass the emacs barrier... some day...)

Just to give you a brief taste of how I use it, here is a screenshot of the
root directory of my WorkFlowy:

### 2) It works AMAZINGLY with the most effective productivity system I've ever found

> _Note: Those who know me well know the magnitude of what it means for Jonathan
to say that something is the most effective productivity system)_

My former colleague, [Zach Latta](!zachlatta.com) told me about [this
productivity system written about on Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8804080) he discovered on Hacker
created by [Drew Crawford](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=drewcrawford).

This is the number 1 most useful productivity tip I've ever found and I've been
developing my own version of it ever since. I'll write a blogpost about how I do
this eventually...
